# Remote-Controlled Car using Arduino and NRF24L01

This project includes a remote-controlled car system built with Arduino UNO and NRF24L01 wireless modules. It consists of two units: a handheld transmitter and a car receiver.

## 🧰 Hardware Components

- 2x Arduino UNO
- 2x NRF24L01 wireless modules
- L298N motor driver module
- DC motors
- Power supply (batteries)
- Switches/buttons (for control)
- Chassis and wheels

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Tay_Dieu_Khien.ino` | Code for the handheld controller (transmitter) |
| `Xe_Dieu_Khien.ino` | Code for the car (receiver) |

## 🚗 Features

- Wireless communication using NRF24L01 (2.4GHz)
- Basic forward, backward, left, right control
- Simple and low-cost design using Arduino UNO

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Upload `Tay_Dieu_Khien.ino` to the transmitter Arduino.
2. Upload `Xe_Dieu_Khien.ino` to the receiver Arduino.
3. Connect NRF24L01 modules to each board according to the pin configuration in the code.
4. Power both systems and use the controller to drive the car wirelessly.
